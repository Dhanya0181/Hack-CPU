# Hack-CPU

Done as part of Nand2Tetris Course in Coursera.

Designed a 16 bit CPU based on Von Neuman Architecture.

The ALU is capable of doing 18 operations.

The memory contains a 32K ROM (Instruction Memory), 16k RAM (Data Memory) , 8K Screen Memory map and 1K Keyboard map.


The project started from the very basic nand gate and developed components step by step.

Project 1 : Basic gates

Project 2 : Combinational Circuits

Project 3 : Sequential Logic

Project 4 : About Assembly Language

Project 5 : Hack CPU

Project 6 : Assembler for Hack Computer
